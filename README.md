2. Memory-based
3. Model-based

Problem Statement

Many of the movie recommendation systems employed by various streaming platforms have been in mature stage, I believe that there is still room for improvement. There is one particular thing that bothers me when I search for a movie to watch, where the recommendations are too heavily influenced by the previous movies that I watched. Once in a while, I would like to watch a movie that is not in the same genre as the previous ones.
